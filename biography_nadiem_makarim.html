<p><h3>Nadiem Makarim</h3></p> 

<p>Nadiem Makarim who has a master's degree in business administration from Harvard Business School was born in Singapore. When Mr Nadiem Makarim returned to Jakarta after graduating from Harvard in 2011, he took motorcycle-taxis to get around the city but found them unreliable. Indonesia's biggest problems - poor infrastructure and massive traffic jams - turned out to be big opportunities for him.</p> 
<p>He had the idea of creating his own network of "ojeks" - as these two-wheeled cabs are known locally - and allowing commuters to book them with a smartphone app. With borrowed money as well as his own savings totalling US$100,000 (S$142,000), he launched the Go-Jek ride-hailing app in January, 2015 with a pool of 700 motorbike riders.</p>
<p>In barely two years, the start-up is already going places, valued at more than US$1.4 billion and boasting the country's largest network of motorcycle-taxis, with more than 250,000 riders in 15 cities.</p>
