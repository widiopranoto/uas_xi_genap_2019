<p><h3>Roger Parker</h3></p> 

<p>Roger Parker was born in Australia. When he was 18, he went to America with his brother. He had always wanted to be a cowboy, and in America he got a job on a ranch and learnt to ride.</p> 
<p>When I was 22, I started riding wild horses in rodeos. Then, when I was visiting my family in Australia, they were shooting a film near my home. The film company needed a good rider and I got the job.</p> 
<p>After that I became a stunt rider in films. I live in Canada now, but I travel all over the world to work in films. I’ve been in movies with lots of famous stars.</p> 
<p>It’s great fun doing stunts. I’ve had a few accidents of course. In my first film, I was on fire but the fire didn’t stop, and I was badly burnt. In “Running Fast”, I fell down from a running car and broke my legs. I spent a month in hospital. But that’s part of the job, and it’s a job I love.</p>
